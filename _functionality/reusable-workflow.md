#  Reusable CI/CD Workflow for Services
## **User Story: FSI-Compliant Reusable CI/CD Pipeline**

* **As a** DevOps engineer in a financial services organization
* **I want** a reusable GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline template that meets FSI regulatory standards
* **So that** all microservices can be deployed securely and compliantly with consistent quality gates

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **AC.1:** Pipeline template supports multiple microservices through reusable workflows
- [ ] **AC.2:** Implements mandatory security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency vulnerabilities)
- [ ] **AC.3:** Enforces code quality gates with minimum 85% test coverage
- [ ] **AC.4:** Includes immutable audit trail of all deployments with approval workflows
- [ ] **AC.5:** Supports environment promotion (dev → staging → production) with manual approvals
- [ ] **AC.6:** Implements secrets management with rotation capabilities
- [ ] **AC.7:** Generates compliance reports for SOX, PCI-DSS, and regulatory audits
- [ ] **AC.8:** Includes automated rollback mechanism on deployment failure
- [ ] **AC.9:** Enforces branch protection with required PR reviews and status checks
- [ ] **AC.10:** Supports blue-green or canary deployment strategies for zero-downtime
- [ ] **AC.11:** Integrates with container scanning and signs images with cryptographic signatures
- [ ] **AC.12:** Includes automated backup verification before production deployments
