# Build, Test and Delivery Process for Service
## **User Story: Automated Build & Test Execution**

* **As a** developer
* **I want** automated build and test execution triggered on every code commit
* **So that** I get fast feedback on code quality and can fix issues immediately

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [X] **AC.1:** Build triggers automatically within 30 seconds of code push
- [ ] **AC.2:** Containerized build environment ensures consistent results across all environments
- [X] **AC.3:** Build completes within 5 minutes to maintain fast feedback loops
- [ ] **AC.4:** Failed builds immediately notify the developer via preferred channel (Slack/email)
- [X] **AC.5:** Build logs are easily accessible and searchable for troubleshooting
- [X] **AC.6:** Build artifacts are automatically versioned with semantic versioning + Git SHA

## **User Story: Parallel Test Suite Execution**

* **As a** developer
* **I want** test suites to run in parallel with fail-fast behavior
* **So that** I minimize cycle time and get rapid feedback on test failures

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [X] **AC.1:** Unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests execute in parallel
- [X] **AC.2:** Test execution stops immediately on first critical failure (fail-fast)
- [X] **AC.3:** Test results available within 8 minutes of build start
- [ ] **AC.4:** Flaky test detection automatically retries unstable tests up to 3 times
- [X] **AC.5:** Test execution time trends tracked to identify performance degradation
- [X] **AC.6:** Test reports include detailed failure analysis and stack traces

## **User Story: Build Performance Optimization**

* **As a** DevOps engineer
* **I want** build and test performance continuously optimized
* **So that** developer productivity remains high and waste is eliminated

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **AC.1:** Build cache utilized to avoid rebuilding unchanged dependencies
- [ ] **AC.2:** Test cache prevents re-running tests for unchanged code modules
- [ ] **AC.3:** Build performance metrics tracked (build time, test time, cache hit rate)
- [ ] **AC.4:** Slow tests identified and flagged for optimization or parallelization
- [ ] **AC.5:** Resource utilization optimized (CPU, memory) to reduce cloud costs
- [ ] **AC.6:** Build performance regression alerts when times increase by >20%
