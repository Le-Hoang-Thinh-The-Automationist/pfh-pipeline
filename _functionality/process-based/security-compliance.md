# Security, Compliance & Audit Process
## **User Story: Security Scanning Integration**

* **As a** DevOps engineer
* **I want** automated security scanning integrated into every pipeline run
* **So that** vulnerabilities are detected early and regulatory compliance is maintained

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **AC.1:** SAST (Static Application Security Testing) runs on every pull request
- [ ] **AC.2:** Dependency vulnerability scanning blocks builds with high/critical CVEs
- [ ] **AC.3:** Container image scanning prevents deployment of vulnerable base images
- [ ] **AC.4:** Secrets scanning prevents accidental credential commits
- [ ] **AC.5:** Security scan results are archived for compliance auditing
- [ ] **AC.6:** Failed security scans prevent progression to next environment
- [ ] **AC.7:** Security exceptions require documented approval from security team

## **User Story: Compliance Audit Trail**

* **As a** compliance officer
* **I want** complete immutable audit trails for all deployments and changes
* **So that** we can demonstrate regulatory compliance during audits

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **AC.1:** Every deployment logged with timestamp, user, commit SHA, and environment
- [ ] **AC.2:** Approval workflows captured with approver identity and timestamp
- [ ] **AC.3:** All pipeline artifacts (test reports, security scans, build logs) archived
- [ ] **AC.4:** Deployment logs include cryptographic integrity verification
- [ ] **AC.5:** Audit logs are immutable and stored in compliant retention system
- [ ] **AC.6:** Failed deployments and rollbacks fully documented with root cause
- [ ] **AC.7:** Access logs track who accessed deployment artifacts and when

## **User Story: Compliance Reporting Dashboard**

* **As a** compliance officer
* **I want** automated compliance reporting from CI/CD activities
* **So that** regulatory audits can be supported with accurate, real-time data

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **AC.1:** Weekly compliance reports generated automatically
- [ ] **AC.2:** Security scan trends and vulnerability remediation tracking
- [ ] **AC.3:** Deployment success rates and failure analysis reports
- [ ] **AC.4:** Change management documentation for SOX compliance
- [ ] **AC.5:** Access control reports showing who deployed what and when
- [ ] **AC.6:** Data retention policies enforced with automated cleanup
- [ ] **AC.7:** Integration with external GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) systems

## **User Story: Secrets and Configuration Management**

* **As a** DevOps engineer
* **I want** secure secrets management across all environments
* **So that** sensitive data is protected and rotated according to FSI standards

✅ **Acceptance Criteria:**

* **AC.1:** Secrets stored in GitHub encrypted secrets or external key vault
* **AC.2:** Different secrets per environment (dev/staging/prod isolation)
* **AC.3:** Secrets rotation alerts when approaching expiration
* **AC.4:** No secrets ever logged or exposed in pipeline outputs
* **AC.5:** Configuration drift detection for environment-specific settings
* **AC.6:** Encryption keys managed with proper key rotation lifecycle
* **AC.7:** Database connection strings and API keys secured with least privilege
