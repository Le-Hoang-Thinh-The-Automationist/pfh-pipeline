# Deploy & Environment Configuration Process
## **User Story: Environment Promotion Gates**

* **As a** DevOps engineer
* **I want** automated quality gates between environments
* **So that** only verified, tested code reaches production

âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] **AC.1:** Development environment auto-deploys on feature branch merge
- [ ] **AC.2:** Staging promotion requires all tests pass + security scans clean
- [ ] **AC.3:** Production promotion requires manual approval from designated approvers
- [ ] **AC.4:** Smoke tests run automatically after each environment deployment
- [ ] **AC.5:** Performance benchmarks must pass before production promotion
- [ ] **AC.6:** Database migration verification required for schema changes
- [ ] **AC.7:** Canary deployment available for high-risk production changes
